# Individual Contributors License Agreement

Ed-Fi has adopted the Apache Foundation's Individual Contributors License
Agreement as a requirement for accepting a pull request on all open source code
repositories. In summary, [this license
agreement](https://gist.github.com/EdFiBuildAgent/d68fa602d07505c3682e8258b7dc6fbc)
says that you have the right to make this code contribution. Please do read the
details.

Each person will have a one-time request to sign the contributors license
agreement, using their GitHub account. Here's what the process looks like.

1. First Time Pull Request

3. Review the license agreement and click the big "Sign in with GitHub to
   agree" button.

4. After a moment you will be redirected back to the pull request. This may
   take a few seconds - please be patient. Now the PR shows that you have
   signed the agreement, and it is unblocked.
