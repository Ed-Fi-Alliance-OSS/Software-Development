# Individual Contributors License Agreement

Ed-Fi has adopted the Apache Foundation's Individual Contributors License
Agreement as a requirement for accepting a pull request on all open source code
repositories. In summary, [this license
agreement](https://gist.github.com/EdFiBuildAgent/d68fa602d07505c3682e8258b7dc6fbc)
says that you have the right to make this code contribution. Please do read the
details.

Each person will have a one-time request to sign the contributors license
agreement, using their GitHub account. Here's what the process looks like.

1.  First Time Pull Request<br/><br/>

2.  Click the "Details" link, seen in the lower right corner of the above
    screenshot.<br/><br/>
3.  Review the license agreement and click the big "Sign in with GitHub to
    agree" button.<br/><br/>
    ![CLA Document](../../../static/img/cross-functional-projects/image2020-5-27_10-47-22.png)
4.  After a moment you will be redirected back to the pull request. This may
    take a few seconds - please be patient. Now the PR shows that you have
    signed the agreement, and it is unblocked.<br/><br/>
